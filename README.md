# Project: Weather App
This project is part of the curriculum of The Odin Project, a weather forecast site using the weather API that was mentioned in the lesson. The user can search their location and change the temperature mode to Fahrenheit or Celsius. I really enjoyed this project and lessons because I think APIs are such a great way to add something interesting in your work easily. I always thought that adding a loader is hard but it's really not that complex now that I added one. I used the try and catch, async await, fetch, and use SVG for the graphics ðŸ¤–.
